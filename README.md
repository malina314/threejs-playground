# Three.js playground

This repo contains results of my experiments with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
which I made while learning it about 2019-2020.

I've found them recently and decided to share.

**You can test them [here](https://malina314.github.io/threejs-playground/index.html).**

You can zoom in/out with mouse wheel.
